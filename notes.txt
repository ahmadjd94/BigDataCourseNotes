Bdata notes :

lecture 1
__________________________________ 
datatypes :
	structured :SQL 
	unstructured : clear text
	semi-structured  XML

	in hadoop we can deal with all the types 

	hadoop components : 
	1 apache hive , apache Pig , apache Spark

	web1: static websites 
	web2: dynamic website
	web3: user-generated content (wikipedia,twitter)

	challeneges : 
	1 : storing huge data
	2 : processing huge data 

	the idea behind hadoop : storing and retrieving data from big data repo
	scalling up : increase computing power of the machine (EXPENSIVE)
	scalling horizontally : increase number of processing nodes (makes a cluster)
	a user may deal with a cluster as a single node 
	a cluster manages itself to distribute tasks between nodes (master nodes manages the cluster)

	gigabytes : ERP 
	Terabytes : CRM 
	Petabytes : WEB 
	Exabytes : bigdata , sensors ......

	charactaristics of BIG data : 3V's
	Volume : size of the data
		factors increasing the volume of data : 
			transactions , datastreaming from social media and increasing the number of sensors and machines connected
		problems : 
			Storage costs , relevance : determined through analysis (expensive) 

	velocity : how much data is coming  to the company. (rate at which new data is generated)
		MB GB TB ....
		problems with velocity : 
			reacting quickly to benefit from data.
			inconsistent data flow with peaks Daily or event-triggered.


	variety : types of data (structured , unstrcutured, semi-..)
		structured : SQL 
		semi-structured: JSON ,XML 
		problems : 
			how to gather data afrom heterogenic datatypes, link data and cleanse  data
			connect and build relations between 


Threats 
	lakes of data : data that are not connected and hard to integrate

Hadoop : makes datalakes centralized , and eases the analysis of data and allows distrbiuted proccessing using simple programming models , can scale out form single server to thousnads of machine 
hardware indepentent : doesnot rely on hrdware to provide high availability 

hadoop core : storage + compute
	YARN:managaes resources (CPU and RAM)
	HDFS : manages distribued storage
